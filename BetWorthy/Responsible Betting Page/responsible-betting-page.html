							<p>As adults, it’s perfectly fine to indulge in gambling as a fun activity as long as it is
								kept in moderation and you don’t overstep your boundaries. There can be a lot of
								misconceptions regarding the topic of gambling addiction, and for victims, it can be
								difficult to identify when they have a problem or not.</p>
							<p>Gambling addiction doesn’t come in one shape or size. It’s a multifaceted problem that
								requires a unique approach depending on the person. An individual may be addicted to
								sports betting, or they may be addicted to table games or slots. It is essential to
								fully understand the person’s problem, identify if it truly is a problem, and then seek
								help from them. Compulsive and dangerous gambling is a problem, but that does not mean
								that gambling itself is the issue. It is entirely possible to enjoy safe and healthy
								gambling and have a great time</p>
							<p>This article will provide readers with an authoritative voice on how to approach gambling
								and how to engage in it safely. Here, you’ll find tips on how to gamble responsibly and
								what to do if you feel yourself getting out of hand. If you’re reading this article as a
								third-party, concerned about a loved one, then this article will be equally as helpful
								to you as well.</p>

											<h3>1. Make Sure You’re In Control</h3>
											<p>There are multiple ways to ensure you stay in control of your gambling
												habits, and once you can self-identify a potential problem that
												jeopardizes that control, it will be much easier to solve.</p>
											<p>Many consider gambling as a hobby or a form of entertainment, but
												gambling can come with intense emotions and high stakes when not
												properly kept in check.<span>It’s important for the gambler to assess
													how
													much money they are willing to lose and how much time they are
													willing to spend.</span>
											</p>

											<ul>
												<li> Does gambling directly impact your finances?
												</li>
												<li>Are you struggling with making payments, or
													are you having general struggles with day-to-day purchases?</li>
												<li>Are you neglecting friends and family in
													favor of gambling?</li>
												<li>Have your relationships deteriorated due to
													gambling-related issues?</li>
											</ul>
										</div>
										<div class="rbp-right-top-bottom mb-4">
											<P>These are all valid questions one must ask themselves if they feel that
												they are losing control, and ifyou answer “yes” to any of these
												questions, you may have to reign in the amount of time or money youspend
												on your hobby.</P>
										</div>
									</div>
									<div class="col-lg-8 mb-4">
										<div class="rbp-right-top-text">
											<h3>2.The Prove-It Test</h3>
											<p>The “Prove-It” test is an objective way to assess how you are coping with
												gambling in your life. The basic premise of the test is that <span>you
													should
													try to monitor yourself while gambling </span> and address important
												questions
												related to it. A big concern in terms of coping with addiction is the
												denial stage. Often, an individual who is in the denial stage of coping
												with a gambling addiction will become defensive and deny they have a
												problem. Phrases such as <span> “I can quit anytime, it’s just that ___”
												</span>become
												quite commonplace, and family and friends can help an individual take a
												step back and change their perspective.</p>

													gambling-related issues?</li>
											</ul>
										</div>
										<div class="rbp-right-top-bottom mb-4">
											<P>A way to “prove-it” is to write down everything regarding your gambling
												hobby on a piece of paper: how much you’ve spent, how much you’ve lost,
												how many times you deposit a day, and so on. The key here is, to be
												honest with yourself and as objective as possible. Get a friend or
												family member to help you out with this process if you feel like you’re
												obfuscating facts.</P>

											<h3>3. Take The Self-Assessment Quiz</h3>
											<p>In addition to the “Prove-It” test, you can take the quiz below to
												determine whether you may have a problem or not. This test does not
												serve as a means of formal diagnosis but more of a guide to help realize
												your current state and <span>whether you may be addicted to gambling or
													not.</span>

											<h3>1. Help With Budgeting and Spending Control</h3>
											<p>Every online casino will have the option to set a deposit limit to
												control how much you spend. Many casinos have the “unlimited” option set
												as the default, and it can be easy to fall into the trap of not setting
												a deposit limit and losing control. However, the deposit limit tool is
												very useful in preventing individuals from spending out of their budget.
											</p>
											<p>When someone is addicted to gambling, it is common to attempt to try and
												amend their set deposit limit. Typically, casinos make it as hard as
												possible to change this, but they are not allowed to completely restrict
												you from changing it. This can be an area of concern for those that may
												relapse and go back to betting uncomfortable amounts.

											<h3>2. Self-exclusion</h3>
											<p>Self-Exclusion is a very effective way of trying to control your gambling
												habits. It’s not the most extreme measure you can take, but it can
												certainly be hard for compulsive gamblers to restrict themselves with
												the self-exclusion tool.</p>
											<p>If you feel like you need to do a short to medium-term break from
												gambling, the self-exclusion tool is available at all online casinos.
												You can choose how long you want to stop gambling, and then the casino
												will block your account for that set period of time</p>
											<p>During the self-exclusion period, gambling addicts may face withdrawal
												symptoms and try to relapse. They can do this either by signing up for a
												new casino, asking friends to proxy gamble for them, or find other
												outlets to gamble their money. It is important to take this period of
												time as a way to grow and get used to life without gambling. Then, when
												you’re ready to return, then you can have a more balanced relationship
												with it.</p>

											<h3>3. Gambling Blocking Software</h3>
											<p>Gambling blocking software is the most extreme measure one can take to
												try and curb their compulsive gambling habits. There are multiple
												software, web browser extensions, and apps that can completely ban and
												block the user from accessing online casinos.</p>
											<p>There are two different types of software options available to you when
												you decide to install a gambling blocking software:</p>
											<p>Much like self-exclusion, compulsive gamblers can display withdrawal
												symptoms very early on. If you are a loved one, you should stay diligent
												and keep an eye on the gambler’s habits post-block. They may be more
												irritable and display compulsive behavior. If they continue to
												deteriorate, consider contacting Gambler’s Anonymous or other therapy
												options.</p>

										<div class="rbp-right-top-text">
											<h3>4. Limiting Gambling Ads Online</h3>
											<h5><img src="img/rbp-facebook.png"> Facebook/Instagram</h5>
											<p>Although there is no way to block specific categories of apps on Facebook
												or Instagram currently, you can hide ads by clicking on the “x” next to
												the ad. This will help the algorithm learn your preferences, and after a
												while, gambling ads will be filtered out.</p>
											<p>Alternatively, try clearing your browsing data and cookies so that any
												history of your gambling tendencies won’t be remembered by Facebook. The
												same would work with your mobile phone and Instagram.</p>
											<p>Much like self-exclusion, compulsive gamblers can display withdrawal
												symptoms very early on. If you are a loved one, you should stay diligent

												deteriorate, consider contacting Gambler’s Anonymous or other therapy
												options.</p>

											<h5> <img src="img/rbp-twitter.png"> Twitter</h5>
											<p>Like Facebook, there is no direct way to block gambling ads completely.
												The same tactics of clearing cookies and browsing data will work.
												However, you may need to interact with the algorithm and continue to
												close ads or press “I don’t like this ad”.</p>
											<p>You can click this link to personalize the content you see on Twitter.
												De-selecting gambling will remove significant amounts of gambling
												content on your feed. However, de-selecting other related categories
												like sports or fantasy leagues may also help curate a safer environment
												for you online.</p>

											<h3>2. How To Help a Friend or Loved One</h3>
											<button>Start the Conversation</button>
											<p>The most important thing you can do when trying to help someone who
												is
												struggling with a gambling addiction is to take the first step.
												Bring up
												the prospect and gauge how they may feel about their habits. If the
												conversation turns hostile, use gentle language to reinforce the
												fact
												that you’re looking out for them and here to help.</p>
											<p>Remind them that they’re a loved one or a close friend and that
												you’re
												worried for them and looking out for them. Then, once they open up a
												bit
												more about the issue, you can begin to try and understand the state
												of
												their mental health and how gambling may be affecting them.</p>

											<button>Support the Initiative</button>
											<p>Controlling one’s gambling habits can be extremely difficult, and
												they
												will need your help and support. If you see them struggling, suggest
												effective tools such as spending control tools, self-exclusion
												tools, or
												outright gambling blocks. These tools, plus your emotional support,
												can
												help immensely.</p>
											<button>Encourage Positive Step</button>
											<p>You don’t need to go over-the-top with showings of support, even the
												littlest gesture can really encourage your friend to continue their
												journey with gambling addiction. Phrases such as these can help
												invigorate an individual who is struggling with addiction:</p>
										</div>
										<div class="rbp-right-bottom-center">
											<ul>
												<li>“You’re doing well, keep it up.”
												</li>
												<li>“I’m proud of you.”</li>
												<li>“I was worried about you before, but I’m glad you’re doing
													this.”
												</li>
											</ul>
										</div>
										<div class="rbp-right-top-text">
											<p>Variations of these phrases can be adapted depending on the needs of
												the
												individual.</p>

											<h3>3. How To Help a Young Person</h3>
											<button>Initiate An Open Conversation</button>
											<p>When discussing gambling with a young person, the strategy behind the
												conversation is a bit different than when talking to an adult.
												Oftentimes, unless the child has his or her own income source, the
												child
												is gambling with funds given to them by the parents. It is crucial
												you
												do not take extreme measures to ostracize them and create a bad
												atmosphere between you.</p>
											<p>Open the conversation by imploring their thoughts on the issue. What
												do
												they think of gambling, and do they think it could be a problem?
												Then,
												gently press your opinion and ensure them that you’ll be there to
												help
												them through their journey.</p>

											<button>Understanding the Link Between Gaming and Gambling</button>
											<p>Many video games these days blur the lines between what is seen as
												virtual rewards and what is gambling. Players can receive “loot
												boxes”
												as a reward for playing the game or completely certain achievements,
												and
												the probability of receiving rare items that may be worth real money
												is
												akin to that of slot machines and other games of chance. This online
												marketplace of trading game items as a digital currency serves as a
												gateway for many young people into gambling.</p>
											<button>Encourage Positive Step</button>
											<p>You don’t need to go over-the-top with showings of support, even the
												littlest gesture can really encourage your friend to continue their
												journey with gambling addiction. Phrases such as these can help
												invigorate an individual who is struggling with addiction:</p>

													this.”
												</li>
											</ul>
										</div>
										<div class="rbp-right-top-text">
											<p>Variations of these phrases can be adapted depending on the needs of
												the
												individual.</p>
											<button>Control Gambling Adverts</button>
											<p>If a young person has a gambling problem, they may be seeing gambling
												adverts on their social mediaapplications. Children are more
												susceptible
												to advertising tactics, so it is important that you discussthe
												prospect
												of hiding and blocking gambling adverts. You can see how to do that
												on
												our resourcepage here.</p>

											<h3>4 .Limiting Gambling Ads Online</h3>
											<button>Control Your Finances</button>
											<p>The most important thing when helping someone else is to keep your
												own
												finances safe. Never lend money to someone who is addicted to
												gambling
												if you think they will just gamble with it – this only enables and
												encourages their behavior. If you do lend money, make sure it is to
												help
												deal with necessities.</p>
											<button>Seek Help</button>
											<p>If you are dealing with overwhelming emotional stress, whether it be
												directly because of the affected gambler or not, there are many
												helplines to help get you through the ordeal. Never feel afraid to
												talk
												to a professional, as it’s their job, and they are always happy to
												help.
												Also, never feel like your problems are not worth talking about.
												They
												always are.</p>
											<button>Set Boundaries</button>
											<p>You may become frustrated with helping out a gambling addict due to
												conflicts and confrontations, and you may lose sight of the goal.
												Relationships may deteriorate, unfortunately, and you may try to
												overcompensate to help the individual. It is important you do not
												risk
												anything valuable of your own and to set boundaries regarding what
												behavior is acceptable. It is important to keep your self-respect
												even
												when helping an individual go through their journey of problem
												gambling
												recovery.</p>

											<button>Understand the Stages of Problem Gambling</button>
											<ul>
												<li>Satisfied With The Status Quo:</li>
											</ul>
											<p>You may become frustrated with helping out a gambling addict due to
												conflicts and confrontations, and you may lose sight of the goal.
												Relationships may deteriorate, unfortunately, and you may try to
												overcompensate to help the individual. It is important you do not
												risk anything valuable of your own and to set boundaries regarding
												what behavior is acceptable. It is important to keep your
												self-respect even when helping an individual go through their
												journey of problem gambling recovery.</p>

											<ul>
												<li>Consideration:</li>
											</ul>
											<p>In this stage, individuals still enjoy gambling but they are having
												second thoughts on how it impacts their lives. Maybe they’ve lost a
												considerable amount of money but are still financially stable at
												this point.</p>

											<ul>
												<li>Preparation:</li>
											</ul>
											<p>In the preparation stage, individuals are now convinced they need to
												stop gambling andare mentally preparing themselves for the
												eventuality.</p>

											<ul>
												<li>Affirmative Action:</li>
											</ul>
											<p>During this stage, they are taking their first steps to a more
												positive relationship with gambling. It is imperative that they are
												supported by their family and friends during this time as it is the
												most crucial stage.</p>

											<ul>
												<li>Perseverance:</li>
											</ul>
											<p>This stage can be the hardest as it is easy to relapse and go back to
												their old ways. To maintain affirmative action, an individual must
												go through a series of challenges every day to get over the hurdle
												and control their gambling for good.</p>

											<ul>
												<li>Recovery:</li>
											</ul>
											<p>This can look different depending on the person, but generally, those
												in this stage are comfortable with their relationship with gambling,
												whether that be fully quitting or having a more sustainable
												relationship with it.</p>
