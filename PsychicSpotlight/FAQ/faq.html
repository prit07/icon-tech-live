							<p> Individual retirement accounts are tax-advantaged accounts that help individuals
								save for retirement. They come in various forms, including traditional IRAs,
								Roth IRAs, and gold IRAs. As mentioned above, a gold IRA allows investors to
								stash their money in gold or other precious metals. These accounts must be held
								separately from normal IRAs.</p>
							<p>Gold IRAs are also referred to as precious metals IRAs. They can either be set up
								with pretax funds or as a Roth IRA, which is bought with post-tax money. Unlike
								other IRAs, these accounts require purchasing and storing physical gold. As a
								result, gold IRAs require the use of a custodianâ€”typically a bank or brokerage
								firm that manages the account.</p>
