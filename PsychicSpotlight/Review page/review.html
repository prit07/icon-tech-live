							<p>Individual retirement accounts are tax-advantaged accounts that help individuals save for retirement. They come in various forms, including traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs, and gold IRAs. As mentioned above, a gold IRA allows investors to stash their money in gold or other precious metals. These accounts must be held separately from normal IRAs.</p>
						    <p>Gold IRAs are also referred to as precious metals IRAs. They can either be set up with pretax funds or as a Roth IRA, which is bought with post-tax money. Unlike other IRAs, these accounts require purchasing and storing physical gold. As a result, gold IRAs require the use of a custodian—typically a bank or brokerage firm that manages the account.</p>
                            <p>Traditional IRAs allow investors to hold just stocks, mutual funds, or other traditional investments. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) allows holders of self-directed IRA accounts to purchase bars and coins minted from gold or other approved precious metals, such as silver, platinum, or palladium.1</p>

								<li>Precious metals mutual funds</li>
